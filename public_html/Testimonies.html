                <p>I have known Silas for 5 years. Over the years I have experienced an individual who shows up 
earlier than asked, works hard, organized, and carries themselves in a polite, respectful manner. He has shown a deep sense of commitment towards everything he does. In addition, I witnessed his massive 
growth and development towards maturity and character as well.

                <p>I have known Silas for a year now from a software development class, and had an opportunity to have him as a friend. 
one thing that has impressed me about Silas was her ability to accept a challenge and meet it.
As for Silas personality and character, He is very friendly, easy going and can be relied upon to get things
done and follow through. </p>
